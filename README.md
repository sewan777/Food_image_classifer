🍽️ Food Nutrition Estimator

📄 Abstract

This project is a research-based approach to estimating the nutritional values of food using the food’s image as input. The primary focus was to deepen our understanding of machine learning, especially deep learning techniques. We collected image-based food data from various sources and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classification model to achieve the best possible accuracy.

To make the model accessible to users, we developed a web application using the Streamlit and Flask frameworks. The web app allows users to easily drag and drop an image of food, and then extracts and displays its nutritional information.
